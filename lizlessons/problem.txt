Project (Week 1):

This week, you learnt for loops and more input and output handling!

Create a program named createTriangle.cpp

You will take in TWO user inputs. The first input will contain a CHAR type input (a single character)
and the second input will contain a INT type input.

The char type variable will represent what the right triangle will be made of.
The int type variable will represent the dimensions of the right triangle.

The program will loop 3 times. At the end of the loop, print "Thanks for playing! Goodbye!"

```
Please enter the character that will make up the right triangle.
a (userinput)
Please enter the dimension of the right triangle.
5 (userinput)
